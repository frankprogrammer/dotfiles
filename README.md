These are my Windows config files for various tools.

Every folder reprsents a different tool that you can copy over manually or use my
install-dotfile PowerShell script.

The script will install the module powershell-yaml if it is not found

This will copy over all of the nvim settings to the
location inside nvim/install.conf.yaml

```
.\install-dotfile.ps1 nvim
```
